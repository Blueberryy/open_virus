# open Virus
### Welcome to open Virus (Beta)!

This gamemode is an open-source recreation of the popular GMod Tower and Tower Unite gamemode called Virus. The concept is the same, however, there are differences:

* This gamemode does NOT use weapons or content from GMod Tower or Tower Unite.
* Servers can change the gameplay of open Virus.
* open Virus is NOT created by the PixelTail developers. We recommend buying Tower Unite if you want to support them.
* open Virus uses Counter-Strike: Source content.
* open Virus is hosted on Github. The community is allowed to make improvements if needed.


Avoid being infected.
Work as a team.
Use Adrenaline (C) when necessary.
Infect if you're infected.



Credits to the PixelTail developers for creating the multiplayer Virus idea.
Original Virus concept is from the TimeSplitters series.
